Event Handling ~ Document Object Model

Accessing HTML Elements 
-----------------------------------
1. document.getElementByID(id)
    - returns element object or null

2. document.getElementByTagName(name)
    - example - "h1", "div", "p"
    - return nodelist object (all nodes, accessible by index, starting from 0)
    - to be able to see all the nodes ~ you would have to loop through them in a for-loop

3. document.getElementByClassName(name)
    - return nodelist object (all nodes, accessible by index, starting from 0)


4. document.forms[name]
    - return htmlcollection object which can accessed by index 
        ie html code: <form name="some_form"> XXXXX </form> ~ to obtain form info - let some_form = docuemnt.form["some_form];


5. innerHTML vs innertText 
    - example:
        let vairable = document.getElementByID("id_name");
        vairable.innerText = "hello John" - returns only plain text 

        vairable.innerHTML - this would include white spacing and inner html elements such as <span style="color:blue"></span>
